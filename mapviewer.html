                <p>The team created a new basemap Vector Tile Package (VTPK) that excludes building blocks, rooms, and their labels.</p>
            </div>
            
        
            <button type = "button" class="ExpandingButton">Step 2: Create Web Map </button>
            <div class="Article">
                <p>A new Web Map was then developed incorporating this VTPK and added rooms and buildings as separate feature layers on top of it. 
                    This setup allows users to click on buildings and see pop-up information specific to each building, while the background remains 
                    uncluttered with only the VTPK. 
                    The primary purpose of this Web Map is to embed it into the solution using Experience Builder.

            <button type = "button" class="ExpandingButton">Step 3: Experience Builder</button>
            <div class="Article">
                <p> Within the Experience Builder, the team designed two distinct pages. The first page enables users to search for room or building names, with their locations highlighted on the map along with their respective labels. This solution includes all the updated layers and labels from the basemap, as requested by the client. The interactive map ensures users can easily locate specific rooms or buildings with all pertinent details.
                    The second page functions as an emergency map. For this, the team used a VTPK that only includes road labels and added feature layers for safety points, fire hydrants, fire hoses, and assembly points. This Web Map is also embedded in the solution, clearly displaying the locations of emergency equipment and assembly points.
